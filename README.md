# **Titanic**    
The titanic data is about the passengers in the ship . The purpose of the analysis is to study different variables and use the findings to build a machine learniing model to predict whether a passnger is going to survive or not
## Overview of the database
The dataset was gotten from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
The train dataset consists of 12 columns and 489 rows, while the test data contains 11 columns and 418 rows. 
The data consists of 2 datasets the train.csv and test.csv. The two datasets share the same column names. 
Some of the column names includes:
1. Fare
2. SibSp
3. Age
4. Embarked
5. Parch
6. Pclass
7. Survived
8. Sex

## Endnotes
I was able to create a model that can classify a pnone into low cost(1), medium cost(2), high cost(3) and very high cost(4) based on the phone features
i was also able to predict a class for the test.csv which doesn't have a target
